Hotel Booking Application

This hotel booking application was developed through a Udemy Course that I completed. 
It was built using the following tech stack:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- Typescript/Javascript

As the course was built in 2021, I have updated it to use React 18 and modified it to use
Typescript as well.
