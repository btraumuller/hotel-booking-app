Hotel Booking Application

This application I developed was through a Udemy Course that I completed. 
It was built using the following tech stack:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- React/Redux
- Node.js
- Typescript/Javascript

As the course was built in 2021, I have adapted what was being learned to React 18 and the latest version of Redux Toolkit. The course only utilized JavaScript as well so I modified the front-end to include Typescript.
