Hotel Booking Application

This application I developed was through a Udemy Course that I completed. 
It was built using the following tech stack:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- React/Redux
- Node.js
- Typescript/Javascript

As the course was built in 2021, I have adapted what I learned so that the application could use React 18 and the latest version of Redux Toolkit. 
The course only utilized JavaScript so I modified it to include Typescript as well.
